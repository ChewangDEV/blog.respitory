        <h2><u>Monkey D. Luffy</u></h2>
        
        <p id="parafirst">Yo! This is Monkey D. Luffy, and if you're reading this, it means I’ve taken a <br> break from eating meat (which is rare) to write something down. I don’t <br>usually do this, but hey, being the future Pirate King <br>means sharing my adventures, right?</p>
        <h3 class="right">A Dream Worth Chasing</h3>
        <p id="secondpara">Ever since I was a kid, I knew I wanted to be the Pirate King. Not because of gold or treasure, but because it means I’ll be the freest person in the world. If you have a dream, don’t let anyone tell you it’s impossible. Just keep going, no matter how tough it gets!</p>
        <h3 class="left">A Crew Stronger Than Any Treasure</h3>
        <p id="thirdpara">My nakama (crew) are everything to me! Whether it’s Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook, or Jinbe, each of them has a dream just like me, and I’ll fight anyone who tries to take that away from them! If you have people who believe in you, never let them go.</p>
        <h3 class="right"> The Open Sea is Where I Belong</h3>
        <p id="fourthpara">Nothing beats the feeling of sailing into the unknown! I don’t care about rules or what the Navy says—I’ll go wherever I want, do what I want, and live free! The world is huge, and I won’t stop until I’ve seen it all. <button type="button" class="button button1">Read more</button></p>
